This is a simple game where an adventure is running away in the jungle and has to dodge arrows and wildlife.
> *N.B. The final version of the coursework is game_v2.py*


The cheat codes are:
* ***Shift-L*** 
  * Arrows fly through the main character
* ***Caps-Lock***
  * Pause the characters animations and movements (thus allowing him to float in mid-air)
* ***Backspace***
  * Adds 10 points each time it is pressed
* ***Alt + b***
  * Boss key that opens up a website (to the https://www.manchester.ac.uk webpage)
